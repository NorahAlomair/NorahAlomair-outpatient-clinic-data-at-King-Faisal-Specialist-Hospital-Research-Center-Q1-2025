# Power-BI-outpatient-clinic-data-at-King-Faisal-Specialist-Hospital-Research-Center-Q1-2025
Over the past period, I worked on my analytical project for outpatient clinic data at King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center – Q1 2025. I collected data from multiple files, cleaned and merged them, and then designed an interactive dashboard using Power BI that provides visual insights into patient distribution and visit patterns.

🛠 Tools Used
Power BI

📌 Objective of the Analysis:

The project aims to provide an interactive visual representation of outpatient clinic data for the first quarter of 2025 by:
Analyzing patient distribution by gender and nationality.
Highlighting visit volumes across cities.
Analyzing visits by different medical departments.
Tracking changes in the number of visits monthly.
Showing differences between Saudi and non-Saudi patients by gender.

📊 Some Results:

Total visits in Q1: 228,000 visits.

City with the highest number of patients: Riyadh.

Some departments recorded higher visits than others, such as Oncology.

Percentage of Saudi patients is higher compared to non-Saudis.

Females constitute the largest portion of total patients.

💡 As an important practical experience, I learned through this project:
Importing data from multiple files and merging them into a single model.
Cleaning and processing data using Power Query.
Using DAX for calculations.
Designing interactive visual interfaces that facilitate reading and support decision-making.
